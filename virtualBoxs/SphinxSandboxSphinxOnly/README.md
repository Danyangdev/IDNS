Known issues:
Stolen Interface Error:
[Err] [Machine.cc:959] Failed to start anafi4k : net.hook/assign failed.
[Err] [Machine.cc:966] Probable cause for this error: the requested stolen interface (enp0s3:eth0:192.168.42.1/24) does not exist
the .drone file needs the name of the wifi interface, the box tends to change it from enp0s3 to eth0, to make it work, check if the interface is enp0s3 or eth0(use command iwconfig). Then go to the drone.drone file and find this line : <stolen_interface>enp0s3:eth0:192.168.42.1/24</stolen_interface>. Replace with <stolen_interface><<INTERFACE_NAME>>:eth0:192.168.42.1/24</stolen_interface>.
